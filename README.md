### Overview

This repository will be used during the Python programming class to use musculoskeletal model through OpenSim to:

- Use the OpenSim GUI interface
- Scale geometrically the musculoskeletal model to match subjects' specific anthropometry 
- Solve Inverse Kinematics (IK) 
- Solve Inverse Dynamics (ID)

### Class

First class: install all the program needed (OpenSim, Python ...)

Second class: use the Opensim Graphical User Interface (GUI) to launch a model, see the markers data, place virtual markers on the musculoskeletal model

Third class: Scale geometrically the model with Python

Fourth class: Inverse Kinematics (IK) with Python

Fifth class: Inverse Dynamics (ID) with Python
